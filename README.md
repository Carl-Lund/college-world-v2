# Getting Started with College World V2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

## Overview

College World V2 is a new project that aims to recreate the [existing College World application](https://github.com/mjocean/college_world_react) using React, Express, and MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started



## Available Scripts

### React (front end)

In the CLIENT directory, you can run:

### `npm run start` or `yarn start`

Runs the React front end in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the React front end for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your React front end app is ready to be deployed!

### Express (back end)

In the API directory, you can run:

### `npm run start` or `yarn start`

Runs the Express back end in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser or make requests to the API.
